# Optimizations

This snake game is optimized for performance.
- Instead of a typical array, I used a linked list to represent the snakeâ€™s body.
- To simulate movement efficiently, I move the tail segment to the head position rather than shifting the entire body.
- I use a hash map to quickly check if the snake collides with its own body, enabling constant-time collision detection without iterating through the entire snake.
